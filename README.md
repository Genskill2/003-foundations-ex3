# Exercises
## Exercise 1
In the file `power.c`, there is a function prototype declared on top
`int power(int, int);`. This function is not implemented. It will
raise the first argument to the second. e.g. 

`power(9,2)` should **return** `81` (Because `9<sup>2</sup>` is `81`).

Implement the `power` function

## Exercise 2

In the file `factorial.c`, there is a function prototype declared on
top `int factorial(int);`. This function is not implemented. It will
return the factorial of the input number. e.g. 

`factorial(5)` should **return** `120` (Because `1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5` is `120`).


Implement the `factorial` function

# Testing your code
You can verify whether your code is working by typing `make test_power` 
and `make test_factorial` in your terminal.

Once you're done, put the files on github and your code will be evaluated.
